# Last Modified Feature

## Overview

The Last Modified feature has been added to all screens that display data from the database. This helps users understand when their data was last updated and encourages them to keep their financial information current.

## Implementation

### Component: `LastModifiedInfo`

A reusable component that displays:
- Last modified timestamp (relative time like "2h ago", "3d ago")
- Record count (optional)
- Record type (optional)
- Tooltip with exact timestamp on hover

### Features

1. **Relative Time Display**: Shows time in a user-friendly format
   - "Just now" for < 1 minute
   - "5m ago" for < 1 hour
   - "2h ago" for < 24 hours
   - "3d ago" for < 7 days
   - Full date for older records

2. **Tooltip Information**: Hover over the refresh icon to see:
   - Exact timestamp (MMM dd, yyyy HH:mm)
   - Reminder to update data if it's been a while

3. **Record Count**: Shows number of records being displayed

## Screens Updated

### 1. Dashboard (`/dashboard`)
- Shows last modified across all data (assets, debts, family members)
- Displays total record count

### 2. Assets (`/assets`)
- Shows last modified for assets only
- Displays asset count
- Added to both summary and table views

### 3. Debts (`/debts`)
- Shows last modified for debts only
- Displays debt count
- Added to both summary and table views

### 4. Family (`/family`)
- Shows last modified across all family data
- Displays total family record count
- Individual asset/debt tables for each family member also show their specific last modified times

## Technical Details

### Data Source
- Uses `updated_at` field if available, falls back to `created_at`
- Calculates the most recent timestamp across all relevant records

### Styling
- Positioned in top-right corner of each screen
- Uses muted text color to not interfere with main content
- Responsive design works on mobile and desktop

### Performance
- Lightweight calculation using JavaScript Date objects
- No additional database queries required
- Cached with React Query for optimal performance

## User Benefits

1. **Data Freshness Awareness**: Users can see when their data was last updated
2. **Update Reminders**: Encourages regular data maintenance
3. **Data Confidence**: Users know how current their financial information is
4. **Family Coordination**: Family members can see when data was last updated by others

## Future Enhancements

1. **Update Notifications**: Could add alerts for data older than X days
2. **Data Age Indicators**: Color coding based on how old the data is
3. **Bulk Update Reminders**: Suggest updating multiple records at once
4. **Export with Timestamps**: Include last modified info in data exports
